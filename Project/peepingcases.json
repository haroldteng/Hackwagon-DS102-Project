Just big hoo ha since theres lack of substantial actions from both the school and the system. \n\nNow this is the period where students are applying for universities. Just trying to see if the lack of such punishment is a reason for not choosing these schools? In fact lately, now that no one is making waves about it anymore, NUS does not appear to release anymore statements regarding it either. \n\nNow just for some background, cases like these are not uncommon in these schools. Mostly covered up or unreported, is such a culture deterring you? Or its a case of \"no other choices for uni\" so its not like we can do anything about it, so bo bian must apply to these schools anyway?",

            "selftext": "Dear NUS Students\n\nDEAN OF STUDENTS\u2019 CIRCULAR \u2013 SEXUAL MISCONDUCT\nSunday, 21 Apr, 3:23 PM\nI want to begin with this unequivocal message \u2013 the University does not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form. We believe that every case of sexual misconduct must be investigated, and offenders must be disciplined. We are fully committed to strengthening and expanding the infrastructure, policies and procedures to investigate cases of sexual misconduct and to take strong disciplinary action.\n\nOur focus must always be to further educate students, faculty and staff about respect, consent, bystander intervention, and the support available to survivors of sexual misconduct.\n\nWe are sorry for the distressing experience cited recently by one of our students, which is of extreme concern to us. We have reached out to her to offer our support and assistance.\n\nThe offence committed was serious and has been investigated by the Police, who gave the male student a 12-month conditional warning.\nWhen such offences are committed, the NUS Board of Discipline, which comprises student and faculty representatives, also conducts its own disciplinary proceedings.\n\nIt will consider factors such as the severity of the offence, the need for justice for the victim, the rehabilitative needs of the student offender, the safety of the NUS community, and also the decisions and penalties imposed by the authorities.\n\nOur disciplinary sanctions, which are not a substitute for criminal proceedings, can include immediate suspension and expulsion, and/or an official reprimand, with the record of offences and sanctions documented in the student\u2019s formal educational records. The offences and penalties are made available online to all students to view at the end of each semester. You may view this on the NUS Student Portal.\n\nWe hear your concerns about having a safer and more supportive campus environment.\nNUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye will convene a committee to review the current student disciplinary and support frameworks. This committee, which will have representation from the NUS Board of Trustees, will study the approaches taken by other international institutions, and solicit views from you, your parents and other stakeholders. The review is intended to tighten the penalty system for offences that affect the safety of our campuses. We will share the findings of this study and follow up actions with you in the new academic year.\nThere will be two student representatives on this committee \u2013 we invite interested students to send their names and contact details to osasec@nus.edu.sg by 28 Apr 19.\n\nWe urge you to immediately report all instances of sexual misconduct, which will be escalated to trained colleagues at the Office of Campus Security (OCS) for investigation. We have also put in place special investigation and disciplinary procedures to manage suspected cases of sexual misconduct to ensure confidentiality, timeliness and survivor care.\n\nThe 24-hour OCS hotline is +65 6874 1616. They can also be reached on email at ocssec@nus.edu.sg.\n\nWe will do everything we can to ensure that you are safe and supported during your time with us.\n\nAssociate Professor Peter Pang \nDean of Students \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nPreventing and addressing sexual misconduct in NUS\nIf you or someone you know needs to talk or report, help is available.\nStudents may report incidents of misconduct to any one of these channels:\n- Office of Campus Security. Tel: 6874 1616 (Kent Ridge Campus); 6516 3636 (Bukit Timah Campus), and 6222 5568 (Outram Campus) Email: ocssec@nus.edu.sg\n- Office of Student Affairs. Tel: 6516 1177 Email: osalistens@nus.edu.sg\n- Your faculty\u2019s Vice Dean (Student Life) or faculty\u2019s student support managers. Please refer to www.nus.edu.sg/osa/student-services/s3 for the list of contacts.\n- Your Hall or Residential College Master, or residential fellows.\n- Other external services such as Emergency Ambulance (995), Singapore Police force (999).\nWe urge students in need of help to reach out to our support network for confidential assistance.\n- University Counselling Service: walk-ins during office hours.

            "selftext": "NUS\u00a0isn't\u00a0the\u00a0problem for\u00a0two main\u00a0reasons\u00a0\n\n\nNUS\u00a0isn't the judicial system. Even though there is a NUS board of discipline it's\u00a0not equipped to really\u00a0judge or punish offenders.\u00a0Banning him from residential\u00a0areas, suspension and\u00a0expulsion are about the only actions which\u00a0they can take which leads me\u00a0to the\u00a0next\u00a0point.\u00a0\n\nExpulsion\u00a0doesn't\u00a0solve the problem it just\u00a0pushes it\u00a0somewhere else. The\u00a0offender is just going\u00a0to\u00a0apply to another\u00a0university, one\u00a0which\u00a0might not know his\u00a0history which\u00a0leaves even more people in\u00a0potential danger. This is\u00a0just\u00a0like\u00a0the\u00a0Catholic church moving sex offenders around.\n\n\nThus I\u00a0believe\u00a0that NUS\u00a0actions so far are\u00a0appropriate even if\u00a0they\u00a0could be a little more harsh (longer suspension\u00a0for instance). Unless our goal is to chase him out of every local and foreign university, then letting him stay on at NUS with restrictions and safeguards is the better option. Even criminals need education.\u00a0NUS\u00a0can take measures to better protect their students. What we\u00a0shouldn't be doing however is to look to NUS for \"real\"\u00a0punishment.\u00a0\n\n\nNo,\u00a0the real reason we are so outraged by this\u00a0case is the\u00a0lenient punishment that was handled down by the\u00a0police. The sentencing\u00a0let Monica Baey down.\u00a0Wtf is a conditional\u00a0warning? It violates\u00a0two\u00a0important principles\u00a0\n\n\nJustice for the victim. He did\u00a0something\u00a0really bad which caused real psychological damage.\u00a0Letting\u00a0him off the hook with\u00a0a\u00a0conditional\u00a0warning is no\u00a0punishment at all.\u00a0\n\nDeterrence for\u00a0future criminals. Outrage of modesty cases are severely undereported\u00a0due to difficulty of convictions\u00a0and\u00a0lack of institutional support of victims. If\u00a0only 10%\u00a0of these\u00a0get reported,\u00a0and all\u00a0of them get off\u00a0with a\u00a0conditional\u00a0first warning, of which a\u00a0certain percentage reoffend\u00a0and then 10% of them get reported again, less than 1%\u00a0of these cases get prosecuted/punished.\u00a0Against\u00a0those odds- why would it deter future criminals?\u00a0They know\u00a0that if they get\u00a0caught all\u00a0they get is a warning and that the odds of\u00a0them ever seeing conviction is miniscule, emboldening\u00a0them to\u00a0take their chances.\u00a0\n\n\nThus\u00a0I\u00a0believe that\u00a0our\u00a0outrage\u00a0is\u00a0misplaced. Not saying\u00a0it's the police\u00a0fault, they\u00a0are\u00a0simply\u00a0following judicial guidelines.\u00a0Given the rise in outrage\u00a0of\u00a0modesty cases and the fact\u00a0that most\u00a0offenders are\u00a0let off with a slap\u00a0on the wrist,\u00a0maybe the\u00a0judicial balance\u00a0of\u00a0punishment vs\u00a0rehabiliation needs to be\u00a0tilted towards \"we need to slap their wrist harder\".\u00a0\n\n\nThe Monica Baey issue\u00a0isn't\u00a0confined to NUS, and it isn't\u00a0confined to\u00a0universities.\u00a0In\u00a0addition to writing\u00a0to NUS\u00a0to\u00a0better protect\u00a0their\u00a0students, we\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0writing\u00a0to\u00a0judges, the\u00a0police, and MPs,\u00a0pushing for stronger judicial\u00a0sentences for\u00a0first time\u00a0offenders of sexual assault/outrage\u00a0of\u00a0modesty cases.\u00a0Only then can we\u00a0have\u00a0effective\u00a0deterrence and justice for victims",

Yet when we look a bit more carefully, this is obviously a throwaway account, based on profile pic, follower count and handle. The account also cannot be found now. This is problematic as this invalidates the whole basis for the rumour that Nicholas's parents are indeed so and so, but people are treating it as though it is case in point that proves powerful people have better outcomes in the judicial system. This is precisely the sort of ambiguous news that becomes fake news when spun a bit differently, as sites like Temasek Review has done. The account may be a troll, or possibly a friend of Nicholas's, but the likelihood is that what has been said has little if any grounding in reality.\n\nI think that all of us have the responsibility not to spread content that can be easily warped to mean something entirely different. In this case it turned from being a scare tactic to becoming evidence of inequality of rights. This just does disservice to the main message being put out.\n\nI hope people do not take this the wrong way. I do think that heavier punishments are in order. However, succumbing to mob mentality and not critically assessing the information we are receiving is not healthy for the online community. This just means that were base our judgement more on appeals to emotion much more than rationality, and this leaves us open to manipulation by interested and capable parties. \n\nPersonally I feel that some responses to this incident have gone pretty overboard, with fair counter arguments being crucified for not agreeing totally with harsher punishment. I sincerely hope that this does not become a norm, and that civil discussion persists in the face of a topic becoming highly heated.",

            "selftext": "From FB\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe recent saga of Monica Baey has taught me one thing: That the internet is a scary place to be in.\n\nWithin hours of Monica posting her instastory, my Facebook feed erupted with people reposting her story, adding comments about justice not being served/ condemning NUS for sweeping the matter aside and merely asking Nicholas to write an apology letter to Monica/ raging that NUS, Singapore and the world are unsafe places for girls and women because perpetrators like Nicholas get to escape with only a slap on his wrist. Petitions were quickly passed around to give Monica a voice, and to call for stiffer punishments for Nicholas (such as expulsion) and those who commit sexual offences on campus. Many internet vigilantes began digging up similar incidents that occurred in NUS, and many also began naming and shaming Nicholas, his girlfriend and their family.\n\nThis is why I think the internet is scary.\n\n1. No one bothered to check the facts of the case. People were satisfied with the information that they received off of Monica\u2019s instastory, and began going on a social media rampage. What if her story was fake? How different are you from the aunties who forward whatsapp messages in the groupchats?\n\n2. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am not saying that her story is fake, but what if it really was? Would anyone have been able to tame the wildfire? Before NUS could have responded, internet vigilantes had already began digging out information about Nicholas and his loved ones, and blasting them all over the internet. How much damage would that have caused them?\n\n3. Now that NUS has addressed the issue, many people still thought that the decision was unfair. The internet went crazy, enough to get NUS to set up a committee.  \na. However, many failed to understand that the 12 months conditional warning was issued by the police and the AGC, and not NUS. It was also not issued by the judiciary.   \ni. Instead of banging the bottoms of your pans, has anyone asked why was there only the 12 months conditional letter given? Why was there a petition for the school to do something about this issue, but no petition for the police or AGC to address it?\n\nb. NUS suspended Nicholas for one semester. He was also banned from entering Eusoff Hall, and he had to undergo mandatory counselling. A lot of people thought that this was not enough. The question then is, how much is enough? Do we use the Penal Code as an anchor and gauge from there? How do we quantify sexual offences in order for punishments to be enough? Why do people enjoy playing God, in deciding what is enough?\n\nc. The number of cases that the internet vigilantes dug up show that this is not the first time that such an offence took place in NUS. Why has there been a repeat of such offences time and again? What exactly is NUS doing to ensure that such incidents stop once and for all?\n\nI applaud Monica for raising these issues so that people become more aware of the situation. I applaud the people who stood alongside her and gave Monica the voice she needed. I am glad that mental health and the need to cope are acknowledged. However, I am also disappointed in my community in the way in which we have responded to this unfortunate incident. We are basically aunties on the \u201corh hor\u201d bandwagon who name and shame.\n\nThink for a minute of the other victims who thought that this saga and the events that followed, would give them a voice. Will they truly get a voice? No. Instead, the perpetrator\u2019s name, details, and pictures will be plastered all over the internet. They would have to confront the perpetrator and the incident all over again. Most importantly, their privacy would be taken away from them as well. Are we actually giving them a voice, or scaring them into keeping silent?\n\nI encourage you to also think about the person who committed the sexual offence. Is deterrence enough? We smack him on the knuckles with a feather duster, then we put his name all over the internet, then we make him lose his job. When is it enough? Do we stop when he commits suicide?\n\nAsk yourself why did Nicholas commit such an act? Ask yourself what have we been doing in schools, at home, and in our community, that have encouraged such behaviour/ could stop such behaviour from manifesting? Ask yourself, how is Nicholas coping? How do we help him to move on from this? As a community, we stand in solidarity with the victim of such offences, but we need to know that destroying the lives of an offender does not make the situation any better. It makes it worst for the person, his family and loved ones. Is it fair for them to also have their faces and information planted all over the internet? How will they ever move on from this? Shouldn\u2019t we as a community help them through?\n\nWhat about the other offenders? Have we scared them off? What about those who actually need help? Will they be too scared to come forward?\n\nThis is why I think that the internet is scary. We choose the people that we want to fight for. Where were your voices and petitions when other people were victims? We name, shame, and destroy. In a country where its people are the only resource, it is disheartening to see us so quick to tear each other down. How will we ever progress as a community if we can\u2019t help each other to be better people?",

Original at facebook dot com/notes/rachel-koh/of-punishment-and-social-media/10156307137077076/\n&gt; \n&gt; **Of Punishment and Social Media**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; RACHEL KOH \u00b7 MONDAY, APRIL 22, 2019\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I need to clear my head. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I followed the first leg of the Monica Baey saga, until there was too much floating around and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and this saga is making me uncomfortable for multiple reasons.\n&gt; The first reason being that it brings up memories which I don\u2019t want to remember and feelings which I have long buried. Most of you who have been my Facebook friends since university would know my experience, but for those who don\u2019t, here\u2019s the background:\n&gt; \n&gt; facebook dot com/notes/rachel-koh/dealing-with-sexual-harassment/10152641334682076/ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The second being that the internet mob is baying for blood and I really, really don\u2019t like this. \n&gt; My note is going to have a few parts: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. my experience with NUS/law enforcement\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. thoughts on adequate/inadequate punishment\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. thoughts on social media frenzy\n&gt; \n&gt; **(1) My experience with NUS/law enforcement**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I preface this by saying that there are a number of differences between Monica\u2019s situation and mine, so some differences in the way things were handled are to be expected. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In my case, I reported the matter to NUS only at first (I shall not count the earlier 2 police reports a few years earlier since those were \u201cclosed\u201d). \n&gt; The faculty and staff who were in direct contact with me were extremely supportive and contactable during that period. They responded quickly to events as I updated them, and were readily available. They encouraged me to make a police report, accompanied me to the police station, stayed there with me and accompanied me back. Once the police report had been made, they\u2019d follow up with me here and there, and were contactable in case of anything. Apart from that, I received no news from NUS for a long, long time.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; I went for exchange and came back, but there was still no news from either party. At some point, I got in touch with a prof and brought up this matter in the context of some questions regarding online harassment (a topic in that module I took). He spoke to me personally and also set me up with the Dean of Student Life (?) for my home faculty, and she sat with me over coffee to ask me what I thought NUS could do to help. I told her that what I really needed was closure, since silence for almost a year was unacceptable. She agreed to help me check on the status. At the same time, I reached out to the original faculty member who brought me to the police station.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A while later, and I honestly can\u2019t remember how long since this was years ago, I received an email from the latter to let me know that the perpetrator had been suspended from NUS for a while, not allowed to stay in campus housing again, expelled from the supplementary programme we were in (but not his home faculty), and the email also attached his apology letter. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would say this of NUS \u2013 yes, I received more support than Monica did based on her account, and I do appreciate that I was fortunate. I do believe that in general the faculty members who have direct contact with the students are very supportive, but with respect to the internal investigation and timeliness of updates, I wish they were more forthcoming. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As for law enforcement, once the police report had been made, it was just a couple more visits to make more statements, and again, silence for a long, long time. Probably about a year later, I received a letter letting me know that he had been sentenced to 18 months\u2019 probation and mandatory counselling. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In Monica's case, it seems to be a one-time occurrence. In my case, the perpetrator had committed a series of acts against multiple girls over years. This would explain the difference in the sentences. But probation isn\u2019t a jail term either, though it comes with certain conditions, such as regular reporting to an officer. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is this enough still? Even now, I don\u2019t know. Which brings me to my next point. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **(2) Adequacy of Punishment**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What is adequate punishment? Heck, I don\u2019t know. If you\u2019ve read my previous note, there\u2019s a part where I ramble about how I felt that 10 or 20 years\u2019 imprisonment weren\u2019t enough for me to feel vindicated. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I understand perfectly how she felt. I\u2019ve been exactly there, caught up in all-consuming rage and hurt and thinking \u201cI want him to suffer for what he\u2019s done\u201d. At that point nothing can satisfy the victim, nothing. And timing is crucial, because the initial rage that clouds judgment really does boil over. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For me, since I only received news of my perpetrator\u2019s punishments from both NUS and the police perhaps a year later, and I had so much time in between to sort out my thoughts and find my way. By that time, I was quite dull. My only thought was, well, I think he\u2019s had his life shaken up already, if he is remorseful and he doesn\u2019t do these things again, then I\u2019m fine, because it means that the punishment did its work. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You see, that\u2019s the difference that time makes. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Monica received news just ~2 months later. I could say she was lucky not to be kept in the dark for a year by both institutions. But the short time period also means that it is still fresh, and she\u2019s obviously still angry. Add that to hearing from the police that it\u2019s just a conditional warning, and hearing from NUS that its just suspension and an apology letter, to someone who is still experiencing the hurt, I can see how this is not enough. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But then so what is enough? Does she, and do all these armchair critics know what they think to be enough? There is currently a petition going around to have him expelled \u2013 don\u2019t even get me started on the multiple issues I see with that \u2013 but expulsion is a big thing, it really, truly is. Thing is, I feel that the current punishment isn\u2019t optimal either, and I think expulsion is too harsh, but I myself don\u2019t know what could be in between that would satisfy me or most people. A petition for harsher punishment in general, I can get behind. But a petition for expulsion? Who are we to decide that's appropriate?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; We are all humans. We all make mistakes. We should be responsible and bear the consequences of our mistakes. But punishment meted out should be proportional. It shouldn\u2019t be decided in a fit of rage. And mob justice is a truckload of short-term, high-energy passion and rage. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is NUS the only university that has been caught up in drama surrounding their handling of such cases? Nope. Can NUS (and other institutions as well) improve its procedures? Most certainly. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let\u2019s also talk about the punishment from law enforcement. Here\u2019s what I understand of it: it is based on past precedent, it is the result of formal investigations which are now closed, and it was concurred by the AGC. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This guy isn\u2019t the first, and most certainly won\u2019t be the last, peeping tom. Let\u2019s be real, there are lots of perverts around us. Some get caught, some don\u2019t. and for those that get caught, how many do we hear of? There are only so few reported cases that come out in the news. Do any of us have statistics on the number of peeping toms caught and how many of them are given conditional warnings? Do we also have statistics on how many of them go on to reoffend after the conditional warning? I most certainly don\u2019t. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But what if this conditional warning really is the standard? What if the statistics showed that some 80 or more % of people with conditional warnings never reoffended again? Would it change people\u2019s perspectives on this? It can never be 100%. There will ALWAYS be people bound to reoffend. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It wouldn\u2019t quite be fair to give everyone super harsh sentences just so less people will offend/reoffend, especially if there is a group of people there who would have been sufficiently deterred with less. Yet it wouldn\u2019t do to give lax sentences such that people aren\u2019t sufficiently deterred at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps the conditional warning tries to balance this \u2013 to the X% who are sufficiently deterred by the conditional warning, it actually works and they\u2019ve changed for the better without scarring their entire life based on one mistake. To those who reoffend, they\u2019re the ones identified as needing further punishment because obviously a conditional warning isn\u2019t enough? Would these people have reoffended still if they were instead sentenced to a few weeks' jail? These are people who already didn't give a shit about the threat of formal action looming over their heads.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The unfortunate downside of this is that even that few % of reoffenders means more victims. This is something that I struggle to reconcile, and I know that this is what most people feel. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If it really is the case that conditional warnings are generally ineffective then by all means, I wholeheartedly support a harsher punishment. The point is that no one really knows right now, but everyone talks as if they know for a fact that it doesn\u2019t work most of the time. That\u2019s what irks me. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I know I\u2019m doing a lot of theory-crafting here, and I\u2019m also doing this as a neutral, third-party observer who happens to have experienced something similar some 5 years ago, distanced by space and time. I am not by any means an expert in conditional warnings or sentencing and punishment, but perhaps we could all take a step back and stop letting our initial outrage take charge.\n&gt; \n&gt; **(3) Social Media Frenzy**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The great thing about social media is that we can get news about these horrible things out quickly and inspire change. The bad thing is that it tends to lead to mob justice. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What\u2019s happening right now is most certainly mob justice. The guy has been named and shamed. Even his girlfriend has been named and shamed. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Once upon a time, I was a fan of mob justice. I thought, well, people who do wrong should expect backlash from society and this is how we signal that certain actions are inappropriate. This isn\u2019t wrong, but the angry mob has shown time and time again that they have no sense of proportion and no limits. Naming and shaming, doxxing, targeting innocent loved ones, targeting companies they work for\u2026 some of these can be so extreme. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I wrote my first note, I thought long and hard about putting it out there. I made it restricted because I wasn\u2019t sure of the full implication of making it public. And I didn\u2019t want to name names because so many things could happen. I didn\u2019t want this kind of attention, and honestly, it probably wouldn\u2019t have gained much attention because there was no name and no face for a mob to direct its anger at. Such is the internet.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This saga went public and viral, and she has gained lots of attention. The power is now in her hands, with lots of supporters. I only hope she uses this attention for good in the long run. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m glad that this saga has called for change, and has spurred at least NUS to review their handling of such matters. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m not in any position at all to determine her motives. I can perfectly understand if it were out of rage, anger, hurt, a desire for revenge and to make the guy suffer \u2013 as I said, I\u2019ve been there. If her dominant motivation was personal vendetta and attention, I don't blame her, but I also wish it could have been done in a better way. And if her motivations were purely for change, without any vengeance on her part, I would have immense respect for her, because it sure as hell is hard as a victim to be purely altruistic. It is in all likelihood a mix of both, because things are rarely that clear cut. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is her prerogative how she chooses to tell her story, and everyone can have their opinion on how it was done. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the day, knowing the power of social media, I just hope that we all realise and acknowledge the kind of power we could hold in our hands, be cautious with it, and do our best to keep our motivations in check. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There\u2019s just one last important note I have: let\u2019s all try not to compare experiences and say who has it better or worse (for the avoidance of doubt, I would count sexual abuse and rape in a separate category that is unquestionably worse). It really doesn\u2019t benefit anyone to do that. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Someone told me something to the effect of \u201cat least yours wasn\u2019t so bad, you saw his penis only\u201d. I instinctively felt upset. That really isn\u2019t the only thing that happened, and I can tell you that now, 5 years on, whether my eyes are open or closed, I see with absolute clarity the pornographic photo that my perpetrator had photoshopped my face on, and it makes me feel dirty. It is burned into my brain and it will never leave me in my lifetime. All I can really do is learn to live with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Being filmed changing/in the shower once has an impact on the victim, even if it\u2019s just for 10 minutes or less. Having one\u2019s butt grabbed for 3 seconds has an impact on the victim. Being randomly kissed on the lips for 1 second by a stranger in a bar without consent has an impact on the victim. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Each of us is hurting in our own way. Please understand that.",

            "selftext": "[NUS rule book: Make it an open book](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nus-rule-book-make-open-book-033831383.html)\n\n \n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 I feel sorry for Nicholas Lim, who has been outed as the peeping Tom who tried to film a female undergraduate who was taking a shower. Now everyone knows who he is: a National University of Singapore Chemical Engineering student who has been suspended for one semester. They now know he has a girlfriend, and how he\u00a0[quit as a financial representative of Great Eastern Life](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nus-student-leaves-great-eastern-suspended-inappropriate-misconduct-125850778.html)\u00a0before, I am guessing here, it could take the step to show him the door.\n\nI feel sorry for my alma mater and employer NUS, which has been in the news for the wrong reasons in recent time. It has been in crisis management mode since the weekend started, after realising that its demonstrable lack of empathy for the undergraduate who was the victim is earning itself the opprobrium of the public.\n\nI don\u2019t feel sorry for Monica Baey. She got what she wanted: the perpetrator has been named and shamed to such a degree that even incarceration might not be too bad an option. More importantly, she got the university to face up to the inadequacies of its penalty system which, in her case, was deemed\u00a0[\u201cmanifestly inadequate\u2019\u2019](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ong-ye-kung-concerned-manifestly-inadequate-penalties-nus-sexual-misconduct-case-140343953.html) by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung.\n\nI asked a few female undergraduates why Ms Baey, 23, a communications student, didn\u2019t take the route that I would have taken if this happened to me 30 years ago in university: tell some seniors about the matter and have them deal with it. I did so when I was bothered by a lascivious lad who made me cry with his lewd attentions. I don\u2019t know what the seniors did, but I got what I wanted: the boy never so much as looked me again after that.\n\nEvery undergraduate was disconcerted by the question I posed. It sounded like I was suggesting some form of street justice. What they said next floored me: everyone said that their seniors would never want to get involved, because it might get them into trouble too. I suppose the days when gentlemen would guard a maiden\u2019s honour is dead and gone.\n\nInstead everyone goes by the Singapore book: make a police report and complain to the right authorities. Then the agencies go by the book too, investigate and decide on the outcome \u2013 without explaining how they reached the journey\u2019s end. If the outcome is satisfactory, at least to the victim, that would be the end of the story. But if not, the victim who lashes back at the big, bad agencies will always receive public sympathy.\n\nThe police decision to mete out a one-year conditional warning hasn\u2019t gone down well with Ms Baey. Depending on\u00a0[which lawyer you speak to](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nus-peeping-tom-case-lawyers-say-warning-appears-unusual-but-mitigating-factors-need-not), you will have differing views on whether this is a rare action on the part of the authorities which have thrown the book at other first-time voyeurs in the past. Beyond the authorities, no one knows how the decision is made and whether there were extenuating circumstances which led them to give Mr Lim a slap on the wrist. The discussion so far has been one-sided, with Ms Baey giving her account on Instagram and to media, and Mr Lim staying out of sight.\n\nThe university, sticking with protocol, started its own disciplinary proceedings after the police investigation was concluded. No one knows, too, how it decides on the sanctions although it has maintained that it has its own framework to refer to. You can only surmise that the \u201cslap on the wrist\u2019\u2019 played a part in the decision to suspend him for a semester (which undergraduates will say is more like taking a leave-of-absence), instead of the ultimate penalty of expulsion. Its bid to have Mr Lim write a letter of apology to Ms Baey has backfired. It looked like it was written by a very bad PR firm.\n\nAs someone who has been working with undergraduates over the past six years, I know that the university prefers to take a rehabilitative rather than a punitive approach to miscreants. My private sector instincts to \u201csack\u201d or give a student a failing grade have always been met with consternation by other academics. I have been told too many times that the subjects are young people, bright people, who always deserve a second chance or even a third. Contrary to what undergraduates think, it\u2019s harder to fail a student than to award the student a distinction.\n\nIn the field of behaviour, it seems a similar concept is applied. A suspension is deemed a heavy punishment because it delays the process of getting a full degree. Except that these days, unless students belong to households pressed for money, the suspension might well be viewed as a \u201cgap\u2019\u2019 year for them to take a break from studies. I gather that this is one reason undergraduates view Mr Lim\u2019s suspension with such misgivings.\n\nWhat is more unsettling is what NUS vice-provost (Student Life) Florence Ling told The Straits Times about the university\u2019s policy on sexual misconduct. You have to be a repeat sexual offender to be expelled.\n\n\u201cFor first-time offenders, because we are an educational institution, we want to give the students a chance. Student offenders who appear before the Board of Discipline for the first time are given a range of punishments, but not immediate expulsion,\u201d she said.\n\nIt makes me wonder if NUS disclosed this\u00a0[\u201ctwo-strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019\u2019](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/nus-policy-on-sexual-misconduct-cases-second-strike-and-you-are-out) policy\u00a0because it believed that this would assure the public that the university is a safe place.\n\nBut just hours later, the university said it was reviewing this two strikes policy. NUS President Tan Eng Chye said: \u201cNUS will take a hard stand on offences that impact the safety of our students. We must make our campus safe and supportive for all members of our community.\u201d\n\nEven Minister Ong weighed in: \u201cFrom here on, for offences that affect the safety of students on campus, we have to take a tough stand, and send a strong signal to everyone. Two strikes and you are out cannot be the standard application. NUS has to make its campus safe for all students, especially female students.\u201d\n\nThe Vice-Provost, it seemed, mis-spoke.\n\nIn fact, my view is that the punishment must fit the crime. Undergraduates are adults who shouldn\u2019t be treated differently from other working youths if they are guilty of misbehaviour. That this might mean extinguishing a bright future, a lost chance at a First Class Honours degree, or dashing a parent\u2019s dream shouldn\u2019t count as mitigating factors unless sufficient remorse is shown. If other less intellectually endowed youths in the working world have overcome setbacks, so can young people cocooned in the education institutions.\n\nNUS did not say how long the review would take but I am sure the university will be pressured into making public its new and improved \u201cpenal code\u2019\u2019 for a range of misconduct. I think it is a good thing to be transparent, even though it limits the scope for discretion on the part of university authorities. There will, for example, be less debate about \u201cfavouritism\u2019\u2019 or \u201cparental influence\u2019\u2019.\n\nI sometimes wish for a return to the old days when the community policed itself and set its own standards of behaviour, instead of always turning to an outside agency. \u00a0It\u2019s not so much about taking the law into your own hands, then about setting markers on acceptable conduct.\n\nBut if everyone wants to go by the book, then the book must be an open one",

            "selftext": "POLICE MEDIA STATEMENT\n \nThere have been public discussions regarding the 12-month conditional warning given to a 23-year-old male National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate who had committed criminal trespass and insulted the modesty of a female undergraduate at the NUS.\n\nThere are two factors (which are both inter-related and yet separate): the first relates to rules to ensure that premises like NUS provide a safe environment, and the second relates to criminal prosecution. On the first, Police understand that NUS is reviewing its rules, on how such conduct is to be treated.\n\nOn the second issue: Police and AGC understand public concerns, on ensuring that our laws and enforcement provide sufficient protection for potential victims, and sufficient deterrence against would-be offenders. That is the approach that Police and AGC take.\n\nIn deciding whether to recommend prosecution for a criminal offence, a number of factors are considered by Police in each case, including the age of the accused, the likelihood of reoffending/rehabilitation, the extent of remorse shown, whether there are aggravating factors (for example, like circulation of the offending images).\n\nIn this case, the accused was assessed to have a high likelihood of rehabilitation, and was remorseful. There were also additional factors relating to his conduct which were relevant, such as the absence of other obscene materials in any of his devices. A prosecution, with a possible jail sentence, will, likely ruin his entire future, with a permanent criminal record. Taking into account these factors, he was given a conditional warning, which means that if he commits any other criminal offence within 12 months, he will be liable to be prosecuted for both this current offence and the subsequent other offence. He will then likely face a jail sentence.\n\nOur criminal justice system seeks to temper punishment and deterrence, with giving offenders a second chance to reform, based on assessment of the relevant factors.\n\nThe approach in this case is consistent with the approach taken in other cases. There have been a number of similar cases, where such conditional warnings have been given.\n\nWhere other relevant factors are involved, for example, a prior criminal record, premeditation to evade detection, there will often be a prosecution.  \n\nAllegations that the man was not prosecuted because he has influential parents are untrue - the Police and AGC did not consider his parents' background. Such factors are irrelevant considerations. It is unfortunate that such untruths have been put out. The man\u2019s parents have agreed for it to be disclosed that his father is a driver in the public transport sector and his mother is a housewife.\n\nThe Police are also aware of comparisons being made between this case and a 2015 case involving a 23-year-old man who was charged and sentenced to 10 weeks\u2019 imprisonment for filming a woman showering at Republic Polytechnic (RP). The accused in the RP case had committed multiple criminal trespass offences, taken deliberate action to avoid detection by covering up the CCTVs in the vicinity and covering his face with a towel, and did not own up voluntarily but was arrested following Police investigations to track him down. He was a former student of RP and had committed the offences over a period of four months.  As such, the Police, in consultation with the AGC, prosecuted him in court. The facts in that case are quite different.\n\n#sgpoliceclarify",

Not just NUS, the Ministry and I am sure the prosecutorial process as well. \n\nExposed fundamental flaws very quickly - the 2 strike rule argument for example was struck down within hours of it being raised by the very organisation that raised it. \n\nThe local press was pretty marginalised from the start and certainly not in a position to shape the narrative. They pretty much could not get on the train. The power of people essentially took over. Are the days of the traditional press including its digital version numbered?\n\nAbility to see a wide variety of views - some very critical of Monica to those who were totally behind her. Anyone and everyone could voice their opinions albeit lots of passion involved as well\n\nThe repeat claims of mob mentality, herd instinct, baying for blood, social media frenzy,  painted as scary did not manifest itself in the form of vigilante action as suggested by some. This is the part that can get out of hand. \n\nThere was also 2 individuals who wrote lengthily essays with similar experiences as victims by were attempting to school Monica when they themselves made no attempt or had the courage to speak up earlier.\n\nSome considered Nicholas the victim and the Monica the troublemaker. \n\nAnd lastly the usual array of erroneous information that is expected of any controversy whether in social media or any other platform but certainly more amplified if it is the social media.",

            "selftext": "**Rant Ahead**\n\nNow that both sides of the story are out, there is no more second-guessing and speculating. No more speculating on what Baey's intentions were nor what she intended her Instagram posts to be for. No more saying that she was scared for her life and never thought of the consequences. \n\nI wasn't going to write or comment any further on this terrible saga anymore because I am frankly tired of hearing about it until I saw Baey's interview video on The Straits Times' Facebook page. Hearing her repeatedly lie and deceive the public about exactly why she posted what she did seriously made my blood boil. \n\n**She flat out states that  the Instagram posts were NOT for the purpose of seeking revenge against Lim, NOT to make Lim suffer, NOT to get him expelled from NUS or to take away his future opportunities and last of all, NOT to make him see the light of day again. If anything, these are exactly what has happened. Did she not think that the outcome would be obvious?\n**\n\nI came into this whole shitstorm with an open mind and a supportive heart. I sympathized with Baey because she was the victim of something truly abhorrent. Nobody deserves to go through what she did. However, the more I heard about the details of what she did in response to Lim's verdict, the angrier and less sympathetic I got. \n\nFact: Baey knew that the whole issue had gone through due process and investigation by the police. \n\nFact: If she did have an issue with the verdict, it did not have anything to do with Lim. She should have taken the issue up with NUS and the police. \n\nFact: Baey absolutely knew that doxxing Lim in front of the whole world would make his life a living hell. Lim is now public enemy No. 1. \n\nLim and his family would not have been subject to such a terrible and frankly frightening degree of harassment but for Baey's doxxing. This is absolutely indisputable. It is clear as day that she set out to destroy Lim's life when the justice system failed to do so in a way that satisfied her bloodlust. Baey had a personal vendetta against him and the posts were her weapon. If her goal was to \"inspire change\" or \"help sexual assault victims\", what purpose did posting all of Lim's personal and private information have to do with it? \n\nI was able to stomach the false claims, the doxxing, the rampant denial among certain redditors in r/singapore who felt that his doxxing was justified or allegations that I was demeaning a sexual assault victim and doubting her. I even accepted the claims that social media was her only way to raise awareness about the problem. But the straw that broke the camel's back was her blatant lying of exactly what her motivations were on the ST video. She confidently states that it was all innocent while the Instagram posts containing various falsehoods and accusations that stirred the public's anger still proudly stands on the front page of her IG. \n\nI stand by my view that Monica Baey is a dishonest, self interested and vengeful hack that has absolutely no respect for the law and due process. \n\nI stand by my view that the tables have absolutely turned and she is now the villain. \n\nAnd\n\nI stand by my view that all of you need to take a good, long look in the mirror and ask yourselves if this is what you think this is what justice is.",

            "selftext": "I'm very opinionated on almost every aspect of this whole situation, from the doxxing, vigilantism, punishment, everything. \n\nThis rant isn't about my opinions. So far in every discussion we're always attacking someone. Whether it be Monica, her supporters, Nicholas, his apologists, nus, agc you get the point. Yeah enough of that (I'll try not to be hypocritical about this but like I said I too am very opinionated so bare with me if that seeps out in my rant). \n\nDiscussion is ultimately a good thing, and as an online community, we should be all about that. This time however, everyone did poorly. It was all heat and barely anyone changed their minds. We did not have a very fruitful discussion that ended with everyone taking something away from. These are just some things I personally found distasteful and hope won't be in our future discussions regarding similar topics \n\n**Edit after finishing my rant: Think there's several run on sentences and a little rambling down there. Some of my ideas got expressed a little loosely and there's some topics and points I wanted to add but at this point, I'm too tired to fix all that, maybe I'll update later. \n\n\n\ni) Attacking Monica for being a, 'vicious, vile and vengeful creature. \n\nWhat's wrong with a victim wanting revenge? Pretty normal and understandable if you ask me, albeit perhaps not the most effective way to prevent more cases like this. Obviously most of us aren't saints, devoid of any bitterness in our hearts. Clearly Nicholas isn't a saint, we all make mistakes, though, none of us really casually make the mistake of sexually harassing someone. \n\nI admire people who can forgive even the worst of people, but I do not expect it, period. Is there any real reason to hold Monica up to the standard of a saint who harbours no bitterness or vegefulness, when it's not a quality to expect in a normal person? Let alone be displayed by a person who's just been sexually harassed and will likely need time to sober up from the rage to think straight? \n\nAnd if Monica is a 'vicious, vengeful, vile, vindictive creature (the list of attacks against her goes on, it really does)' What does that make Nicholas, who had completely no reason to take a video of her completely naked, other than his severe lack of self control? \n\n\n\n\nii) The holier than thou attitude\n\nIt is entirely impossible to have a discussion on morality without asking and answering the question, 'who decides what morality is?' \n\n'Why do people play god and decide what's moral and what isn't?' 'Why do people feel the need to pass judgement on Nicholas when the judiciary system has already done that?' 'Why are people weighing in on the situation with their own ideals of morality?' \n\nIf you make any argument that Nicholas should have received a heavier punishment, you're immediately put into the category of people who are 'baying for blood' or assuming a 'holier than thou' position. \n\nIronically, this to me is the absolute epitome of assuming the holier than thou position. This line of thought automatically assumes the judiciary system's holiness and upholds it as a paragon of morality. \n\nThe judiciary system plays god and decides the appropriate punishment all the time, passes judgement, weighs in with their own ideals of morality and takes matters into their own hands. How is that in any way different from what anyone else is doing. When their opinions are worth more than anyone else's for no reason other than they're part of the judiciary system, and not based on the contents of their arguments, that is absolutely what assuming the holier than thou position is. \n\nLiterally every argument on the subject of morality that you disagree with will sound like they're virtue signalling and claiming the moral high ground, that's exactly the purpose of moral arguments, it's in their nature. Despite this we must be tolerant of different opinions, open minded, and always try to make sure our discussions are fruitful with everyone learning and minds changed in the end, instead of just disregarding other arguments because they're 'virtue signalling'. A fruitful discussion on morality is a very important one to have if we want to better ourselves as a society.\n\n\n\niii) What could we have done better in discussing the topic? \n\nFirst and foremost, everyone should have immediately doubted the authenticity of claims made on instastories. Although, y'all on reddit are smarter and already did that but still, anyways\n\nWe could have discussed vigilantism as a whole, we could have discussed if or how the judiciary system makes better, more moral and appropriate decisions than people who disagree and feel the need to take matters into their own hands. \n\nWe should have placed more emphasis on what the appropriate amount of punishment was for Nicholas. Another reddit user asked this very question though I still feel there was not enough activity on that thread. \n\nLet's be real, if Nicholas was at least expelled so that Monica wouldn't have to see the guy filming her shower at school after just a semester, this whole thing wouldn't have blown up in the first place. Saying that people are literally going to take justice into their own hands and hurt Nicholas themselves or that they'll continue asking for heavier and heavier punishments, are rather cynical and baseless claims. Sure you'll never be able to please everyone but I bet you could please most people including the victim reasonably. \n\nNicholas got a very, very light punishment in the first place, no doubt about it, but with his trial by social media, it would be unfair for nus or agc to appropriately punish him now as he'd be going through to the system again (albeit, this time more appropriately) and he'd still have an angry mob judging him. There simply doesn't seem to be a way to make things right at this point and we can only move on and focus on finding a better approach to these incidents next time. \n\nWe could have compared ourselves to other countries. If you're of the opinion that rehabilitation is the way to go, there's a very strong case for that. Look at Norwegian prisons and their amazing recidivism rates for example. And from that, we could have discussed how necessary retribution is, does it help the victim and her family move on? Does it help the rest of society move on? Does the victim deserve to see her perpetrator face retribution? We could also look at the sex offender registry in the states. Does alerting the public of sex offenders really help? Does it destroy the offenders life by having that on their record? Do people, employers especially, have a right to be informed if someone is a sex offender? \n\nMy point is most of us already have our own stances on the issue but we still don't have the answers to everything. If we spent more time discussing and finding solutions instead of attacking people, we'd all likely come to agreements. \n\nAnyways, now we can all get upset by the new peeping tom from ntu, isn't that just lovely?",
