5#The law has not been fair to Monica Baey. Many people are clamoring how this ruins Nicholas Lim Jun Kai’s life. But had anyone stopped to think that what Nicholas did has ruined Monica’s life irreversibly too. She basically watched the perpetrator lives his life as usual, unaffected. On the other hand, the psychological damage had been done too. Imagine how many times she is thinking whether the video had been distributed, etc. The police might have been able to verify if the video had been deleted without distribution but the damage is there.#bgbm2u#[Unpopular opinion] about the recent saga of Monica Baey#Removed#04/23/2019 03:42:56

62#Why do we need to reflect from something that he has done outright morally wrong. True that we learn things from the environment that we live in, but YOU YOURSELF have the knowledge to decern what is right and wrong and its not fair to ask US to be considerate for him when he did something that is wrong. Put yourself in the victim's shoes and that when you're so distraught by the situation and you know that the perpetrator will return after one semetester and be so cautious and wary in everything you do in school. I also wouldn't think you would ask the others to reflect on their actions and how the society could contribute to Nicholas's act if the victim was a family member of yours. Reactions are strong because THIS SOCIETY has always been blaming the victims and asking them to consider what they did to make the perpatrator commit what he did and we seriously need to MOVE ON from that concept I swear.#bgbm2u#[Unpopular opinion] about the recent saga of Monica Baey#Deleted#04/23/2019 03:42:56
